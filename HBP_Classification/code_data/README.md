This project developed with Python 3.6. To run .py scripts, you need to get Python 3.6 to run .py scripts.There are 5 .py scripts:The first 4 .py script uses dataset.csv file.main.py:  includes selected best fitted 4 algorithm with k-fold cross validation splitting. It can be used for further data examining.data_visualization.py can be use only for dataset visualization such as histogram plotting.modelselection.py includes all algorithms without k-fold cross validation. Its output gives models’ accuracy scores, confusion matrixes and classification report.modelSelection_cv: Gives an algorithm comparison plot. K-fold cross validation applied on this script.sensorTest.py: It is used for feature extracted dataset. This file has different file coloumn features, because of that this file has compability with dataset_gaw_sensw1.csv, dataset_gaw_sensw2.csv, dataset_gaw_sensw3.csv, dataset_onlySenscsv files. To try different dataset on sensorTest.py file name changed in line 32.
